1* review and test client set api, and then write a get https call to https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<your-word> to print the meaning of 5 words on a thread pool of T threads having a client_set of size N, and then merge with master
2* test old api using serc and cashed, and discard transaction client interface from both of them and modify them to use client_set instead
3* propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries, serc, cashed, and test the new stream api there
4* build streams for (cutlery) pipes


Far Future
5* server passes on its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
6* build write and read stream api for zlib compressors and decompressors
7* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
