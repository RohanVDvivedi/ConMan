1.1* shrinking of unread_data in stream
1.3* dstring_stream
1.4* test cases for piped_stream and writable_dstring_string
1.5* merge with master

2* test old api using serc and cashed, and discard transaction client interface from both of them and modify them to use client_set instead
3* propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries, serc, cashed, and test the new stream api there


Far Future
4* server passes on its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
5* build write and read stream api for zlib compressors and decompressors
6* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
