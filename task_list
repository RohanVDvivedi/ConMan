1* modify connction_group to just conn_address pass conn_address to server handlers
2* simplistic helper functions to create SSL_CTX
3* add DNS resolver helper methods for transaction client
4* add client_port to connect using an explicit port (-1 for not binding)

5* client connection functions to return streams (rpoviding simple fd and ssl stream)

6* build streams for (cutlery) pipes
7* transaction client mods to using only stream based api, obliterate tclient to just maintain a queue of empty connections to a server and give these to requesting threads on a hire, such that they are returned later on and rename transaction client to active_client_set


8* (future) build write and read stream api for zlib compressors and decompressors

9* (future) propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries

 --1* write new testcases and test old functioning using Serc and current test cases at every point

10* (future) look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
