1* propogate stream and client_set api to cashed.

4* move certain static functions to Cutlery like get_digit_from_char
5* writable_dstring takes pointer to dstring to append to a dstring, making underlying dstring just as if it was an underlying stream

Far Future
2* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
3* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
