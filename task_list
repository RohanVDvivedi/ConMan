Immediate tasks
1* server passes on its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how

Testing of the new mods
3* write a get https call to https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<your-word> to print the meaning of 5 words on a thread pool of 3 threads having a client_set of size 2
4* test old api using serc and cashed
5* propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries, serc, cashed, and test the new stream api there

Future
6* build write and read stream api for zlib compressors and decompressors
7* build streams for (cutlery) pipes, that can be initialized using a dstring

Far Future
8* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
