 * segregate code for udp server/client leaving it with previous api

 * use streams instead of raw file descriptors in handlers
   * start with implementing file descriptor based streams
   * then replace that in all the later projects
 * build streams for file-descriptors (including the one for stdio), dstrings and pipes
   * provide vsnprintf and vsnscanf like utilities for write_stream and read_stream respectively
 
 * The library is working perfectly fine as a multi threaded TCP/IP or UDP/IP server. As a maintainer I also aim to also provide functionality for non-blocking serve() function, in the future development.
   	 * use epoll (edge triggered) and not select or poll (level triggered) based

 * propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries
