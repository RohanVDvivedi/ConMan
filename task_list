 * in all sources, fail if the dstring or dpipe functions fail (including their initialization or expansion)
 * add stream error codes, for FAILED_TO_APPEND_TO_WRITE_BUFFER_IN_STREAM and FAILED_TO_APPEND_TO_UNREAD_BUFFER_IN_STREAM, retrun them respectively on read, unread and write calls of stream
 * change unread_stream api to return void and take in int* error to return FAILED_TO_APPEND_TO_UNREAD_BUFFER_IN_STREAM
 * update all downstream apis, HTTPparser, Serc and JSONparser

1* propogate stream and client_set api to cashed.

Far Future
2* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
3* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
