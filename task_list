1* propogate stream and client_set api to cashed.

4* look for locking in stream, how it might benefit implementing something like http 2, and if this problem can be circumvented using external locks
5* look for stream api to buffer every call to write, and perform write only when a write_flush is called on the stream

Far Future
2* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
3* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
