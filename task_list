0* optimize read until dstring stream, reduce read calls to underlying stream and read and write calls to intermediate dpipe of matched bytes
0* make read uint64 to read unsigned long long int, and calculate max bytes to read as a static variable inside function, using division by radix of the ULLONG_MAX
1* propogate stream and client_set api to cashed.

Far Future
2* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
3* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
4* add reader and writer streams to compress and decompress brotli compression
