 * check after initialize_* (cutlery calls), return NULL or failure but never kill the process
 * initialize_stream may fail, if initialize_dpipe calls fail, need to refactor every where
 * check especially for dpipe allocation failures (initialize_dpipe and resize_dpipe) in stream

Far Future
1* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
2* look into building a framework for select, poll, epoll, aio and io_uring based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
