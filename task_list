 * add serve_using_stream_handlers
 * transaction client mods to using only stream based api

 * use streams instead of raw file descriptors in stream handlers
   * start with implementing file descriptor based streams
   * then replace that in all the later projects
 * build streams for file-descriptors (including the one for stdio), dstrings and pipes
 
 * The library is working perfectly fine as a multi threaded TCP/IP or UDP/IP server. As a maintainer I also aim to also provide functionality for non-blocking serve() function, in the future development.

 * propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries
