1* build streams for dstrings and (cutlery) pipes
2* simplistic helper functions to create SSL_CTX
3* add DNS resolver helper methods for transaction client
4* add client_port to connect using an explicit port (-1 for not binding)
5* transaction client mods to using only stream based api
6* build write and read stream api for zlib compressors and decompressors
7* propogate the connection_stream based api to dependent libraries

 --1* write new testcases and test old functioning using Serc and current test cases at every point

8* (future) look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
