 *2 fail if the dstring concatenation in stream util fails
 *1 logic to force close a stream connection in client_set, on returning a client
 *3 streams will return an error instead of failing silently, when reading from a non readable stream or writing to a non writable stream

1* propogate stream and client_set api to cashed.

Far Future
2* server passes on (comm_address) its own server address and client address to its stream_handlers some how
3* look into building a framework for select, poll and epoll based non_blocking support for client or server, and how should an api look like, like storing a void* per file descriptor and etc
